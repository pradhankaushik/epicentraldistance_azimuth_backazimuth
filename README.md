# Earthquake_source_station
The program finds out the epicentral distance,azimuth and backazimuth given the latitude of source and station. Besides this,it rejects invalid inputs such as strings, impossibel latitute and longitudes. It allows an user to either use geographic coordinates or geocentric conrdiantes. This is a part of my seismology lab course assignment.
